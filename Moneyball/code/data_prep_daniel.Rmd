Steps:

- 5 Number Summary + Outlier Detection
- Deal with Outliers:
  - keep if a part of the data
  - if not apart of data population, remove
  - if error, try to fix (0 values and outliers)
  - Winsorize
- Transform
- Impute

Missing completely at random (MCAR) when the missingness mechanism is completely independent of the estimate of our parameter(s) of interest. Deletion will yield unbiased results.


Missing at random (MAR) when the missingness mechanism is conditionally independent of the estimate of our parameter(s) of interest. In short, the data with complete cases are biased.


Missing not at random (MNAR) when the missingness mechanism is associated with the estimate of our parameter(s) of interest

```{r}
percentMiss <- function(x){sum(is.na(x))/length(x)*100} # Creates percentage of missing values

variable_pMiss <- apply(train,2,percentMiss) # 2 = runs on columns
sample_pMiss <- apply(train,1,percentMiss) # 1 = runs on rows
```

```{r}
variable_pMiss
sum(sample_pMiss > 50)
```
|   We can see that most variables have low percentage miss rates. Two variables TEAM_BATTING_HBP and TEAM_BASERUN_CS have 91.6% and 33.9% missing rates which leads to a recommendation to remove at least TEAM_BATTING_HBP from the dataset. Should TEAM_BASERUN_CS be removed for having more than 25% of observations missing its value?


```{r Check Rows for Miss Data}

Since only one row has a 0 value, and it is in the Wins column. It will be left in the dataset as it seems a possible value.

```{r}

# which()

train_winsor[rows_with_zero,]

colnames(train_outs_drop)

rows_with_zero <- which(apply(train_outs_drop == 0, 1, any)) # apply will create a vector of T/F that determines if row has 0 in it
# which()


train_outs_drop[rows_with_zero,]
```

```{r Check 0s for Dataset of Basic Cleaned Data}

rows_with_zero <- which(apply(train_cleaned == 0, 1, any)) # apply will create a vector of T/F that determines if row has 0 in it
# which()


train_cleaned[rows_with_zero,]

```
|    28 rows contain a 0 for one of its values. These 0 values are extremely unlikely and will be replaced with NAs. After replacing with NAs, we will see if any samples have more than 50% of its variables missing for removal.

```{r train_0 NA Count}
# Replace 0 values with NA's in rows
train_0 <- apply(train_cleaned, 2, function(col) replace(col, col == 0, NA))

# Convert the matrix back to a dataframe

|    For non-winsorized data, It looks like if outliers can be removed or dealt with, only Pitch_H and Field_E would be needed. For winsorized data, every column was transformed, implying a decrease in normality.

```{r Miss Pattern}

pattern <- md.pattern(train_cleaned, rotate.names = TRUE)

pattern <- as.data.frame(pattern)

pattern
```

|    Batting_HBP is missing for almost all observations and should be removed. There were no samples that had at least 50% of the variables missing, leading to the conclusion of keeping all observations. Only a maximum of 3 features are missing at a time. 3 features out of 14 is less than 50% of the feature count for a sample, so no observations need to be replaced.



|    Imputation will use the MICE package and using the predictive mean modeling method to generate predictions

#norm.predict (imputes based on the "best value" determined by linear reg)
#mice.impute.norm.boot (imputes by log reg with bootstrap aggregation, best for )
#norm.nob (imputes without accounting for parameter uncertainty, Bat_SO looks bad)
#norm (univariate missing data by Bayesian linear reg - Pitch_SO and Field_DP look ok)
#mpmm (imputes multivariate incomplete data that has relationships like polynomials)
#cart (imputes based on regression trees - Bat_SO matches great)

Before changing variables used in prediction methods. The best methods that match are:
Bat_SO - CART
Norm - Pitch_SO and Field_DP
Norm.nob - for any other than Bat_SO
Mean - for Base_SB and Base_CS, Pitch_SO? Field_DP


CART was used for Bat_SO and Pitch_SO as their distributions matched well. Base SB, Base_CS, and Field_DP worked well with mean.
