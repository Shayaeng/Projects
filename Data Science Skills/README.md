## Project overview

To find the most valuable data science skills we collected data from job postings websites like Indeed and LinkedIn. To accomplish this, we created a survey asking respondents what skills they consideer most important. We then ran analyses on the responses and published them. We tried other methods as well but ran into some issues. Those methods can be found in the files here as well.
